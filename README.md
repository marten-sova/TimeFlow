TimeFlo is an implementation of a
[Pomodoro&reg;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)-like
timer for breaking out of flow state.

This document will help you get the dependencies installed and instruct the user how to run the timer program. 
## Status and Roadmap

* [X] Requirements complete.
* [X] Project plan complete.
* [X] Design complete.
* [X] Implementation complete.
* [X] Validation complete.

## Build and Run

1. Create a python virtual enviroment.
```python3 -m venv env```
2. Activate the enviroment.
```source ./env/bin/activate``` For Windows OS: ```source ./env/Scripts/activate```
3. Upgrade pip
```pip install --upgrade pip```
4. Install the requirements 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run the timer. This can also be bound to some hotkey using system sofware to make launching it eaiser. 
```python timer.py```
6. A Qt window should pop up and you should be able to interact with the timer from there. When starting any session the interface will update every second. 

M1 Mac users: If
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
fails to install PyQt5:
1. Install Qt 
```brew install qt5```
2. Make qmake accessible
```brew link qt5 --force```
3. Try
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
again.

or try running Terminal in Rosetta 2 mode:

1. Select Terminal in Finder (usually found in Utilities folder).
2. Right click on Terminal and choose ```Duplicate```.
3. Name the new Duplicate ```Terminal Rosetta2``` for good reference.
4. Right click on ```Terminal Rosetta2``` and choose ```Get Info```.
5. Choose ```Open using Rosetta``` in the popup window. 
6. Follow the original steps ```1-5``` to get the program running.

## Testing

To run tests, go to the root directory and run the command below. It will run through all the state changes. Given the fact that it fully tests the time required to step through everything these tests could take a while to run.
```
python -m pytest
```

## Licensing

This program includes the LGPL V3 license for usage of Qt
